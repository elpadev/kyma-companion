# Serverless Best Practices - Use UI to Explore
At the beginning of your Kyma journey, you will probably want to evaluate Serverless and draft a few Functions.
Kyma dashboard is perfect to gain basic experience and start the journey with Kyma Functions. Its dedicated Serverless features help you draft your first Functions by putting the code directly in the browser using a Web IDE.
Kyma dashboard will also help you expose your Function using HTTP, define environment variables, subscribe to CloudEvents, bind ServiceInstances, and even show you the Function logs - all in one place.
