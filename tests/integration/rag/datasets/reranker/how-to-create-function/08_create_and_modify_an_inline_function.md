# Create and Modify an Inline Function
This tutorial shows how you can create a simple "Hello World" Function in Node.js. The Function's code and dependencies are defined as an inline code in the Function's **spec**.
Serverless also allows you to store the Function's code and dependencies as sources in a Git repository. To learn more, read how to [Create a Git Function](01-11-create-git-function.md).
To learn more about Function's signature, `event` and `context` objects, and custom HTTP responses the Function returns, read [Functionâ€™s specification](../technical-reference/07-70-function-specification.md).
