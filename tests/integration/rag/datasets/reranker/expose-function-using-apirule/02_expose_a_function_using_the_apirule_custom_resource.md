# Expose a Function Using the APIRule Custom Resource
This tutorial shows how you can expose your Function to access it outside the cluster, through an HTTP proxy. To expose it, use an [APIRule custom resource (CR)](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/05-technical-reference/00-custom-resources/apix-01-apirule/). Function Controller reacts to an instance of the APIRule CR and, based on its details, it creates an Istio VirtualService and Oathkeeper Access Rules that specify your permissions for the exposed Function.
When you complete this tutorial, you get a Function that:
- Uses the `no_auth` handler, allowing access on an unsecured endpoint.
- Accepts the `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods.
To learn more about securing your Function, see the [Expose and secure a workload with OAuth2](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/03-tutorials/00-api-exposure/apix-05-expose-and-secure-a-workload/apix-05-01-expose-and-secure-workload-oauth2/) or [Expose and secure a workload with JWT](https://kyma-project.io/docs/kyma/latest/03-tutorials/00-api-exposure/apix-05-expose-and-secure-a-workload/apix-05-03-expose-and-secure-workload-jwt/) tutorials.
