# Traces - Kyma Modules With Tracing Capabilities - Serverless
By default, all engines for the [Serverless](https://kyma-project.io/#/serverless-manager/user/README) module integrate the [Open Telemetry SDK](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/metrics/sdk/). Thus, the used middlewares are configured to automatically propagate the trace context for chained calls.
Because the Telemetry endpoints are configured by default, Serverless also reports custom spans for incoming and outgoing requests. You can [customize Function traces](https://kyma-project.io/#/serverless-manager/user/tutorials/01-100-customize-function-traces) to add more spans as part of your Serverless source code.
